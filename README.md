# FiveMinutesTillFive
Five Minutes 'Till Five is a stealth based game where you are working your regular office job waiting for the clock to hit 5:00pm. Sneak around the office, bribe your co-workers, interact with the environment, and get as little done as possible while still making it to the top!

Created by Henry Boekhoff, Lachlan Imel, Hunter Smith and Richie Mohan
