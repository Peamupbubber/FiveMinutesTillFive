# Five Minutes 'Till Five
Five Minutes 'Till Five is a stealth based game where you are working your regular office job waiting for the clock to hit 5:00pm. Sneak around the office, bribe your co-workers, interact with the environment, and get as little done as possible while still making it to the top!

Created by Henry Boekhoff, Lachlan Imel, Hunter Smith and Richie Mohan

Voiceover performance by Aran Clauson
